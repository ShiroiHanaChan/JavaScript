# Solving Exercises from "Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained" Using JavaScript

Welcome to my project! In this repository, I am solving exercises from the book ["Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained"](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/) using JavaScript instead of Python. This is a fun way to practice and improve my JavaScript skills while following the structured exercises from the book.

## Approach

The book provides a series of exercises designed to help readers understand various programming concepts using Python. In this project, I will be translating these exercises into JavaScript, showcasing how similar problems can be tackled in different programming languages.

## How to Run the Code

To run the JavaScript code for the exercises, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShiroiHanaChan/gentlyexplained-js.git
   cd gentlyexplained-js
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory of the exercise you want to run.
4. Execute the JavaScript file using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node ex1.js
   ```

## Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime environment.

Feel free to explore the different exercises and see how Python exercises are solved using JavaScript. Happy coding!
